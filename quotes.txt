Let's kill all those bugs :) 
My sword is sharp, but my code is sharper. 
A knight's honor lies in the quality of his code, not just the battles he wins. 
I do not fear bugs, for i have the debugger by my side. 
The quest is not for treasure, but for clean code. 
I wield variables as a knight wields his sword, with purpose. 
A knight may fall in battle, but his line of code will stand forever. 
I seek no glory, only an algorithm that runs without error. 
A knight's duty is to protect the kingdom, and my kingdom is the code I write. 
The only code that is truly dead is the one that's been refactored to perfection. 
A knight does not retreat; he refactors until the code is pure. 
To break my code is to break my honor. I strive for perfection with every line. 
A knight may protect his land, but i protect the integrity of every project i touch. 
The true measure of a knight's strength is not his sword, but his ability to craft code that stands the test of time. 
In the kingdom of bytes, I am both ruler and servant, ensuring every line server the greater purpose. 
The knight's code is simple: honor, efficiency, and a commitment to never leave a function broken. 
Chambea, jala. Cabron a ti no te quedan balas !!!
